# Polkadot Ethereum Bridge
Components for a Polkadot Ethereum Bridge

## Components

### Parachain
This folder includes our substrate parachain, as well as our bridge-specific pallets.

See [parachain/README.md](parachain/README.md)

### Ethereum
This folder includes our Ethereum contracts, tests and truffle config.

See [ethereum/README.md](ethereum/README.md)

### Relayer
This folder includes our Relayer daemon that will be run by relayers to watch and relay 2-way messages.

See [relayer/README.md](relayer/README.md)

### Tests
This folder includes our end to end tests, that pull together all the above services and set them up easily through scripts for automated E2E tests.

See [test/README.md](test/README.md)

### Usage
To test out and use the bridge, see each of the above READMEs in order and run through their steps, or just look through the test guide if that's all you need. The full functionality can then also be demo'd using our substrate-ui fork, with extra demo steps described [here](https://github.com/Snowfork/substrate-ui/tree/stable-base/packages/app-polkadot-ethereum-bridge)
