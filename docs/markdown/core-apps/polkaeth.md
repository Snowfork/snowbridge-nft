# PolkaETH

Draft
{: .label .label-yellow }

PolkaETH is a cross-chain application that facilitates the creation and movement of a pegged Ether asset on Polkadot. It allows users to lock up ETH in the PolkaETH application smart contract on Ethereum, and then have that minted as PolkaETH via the PolkaETH pallet on Snowbridge's parachain. PolkaETH can be moved to other parachains and used in their products and applications, or can be burned by users on Snowbridge's parachain to return their value to Ethereum and unlock their Ether out of the PolkaETH smart contract.

Further details will be added at a later point.
