## Introduction

Our parachain supports transfers of bridged assets using [XCMP](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format/blob/master/README.md).

Other parachains wanting to participate in asset transfers will need to hold sovereign reserves in our parachain. This implies a unilateral trust model where:

- Participating parachains must trust our parachain in its role as the reserve chain
- Our parachain does not need to trust the participants

Besides bridged assets, our parachain supports the transfer of DOT, the native currency of Polkadot.

## Asset Location

We can represent the relative location of bridged ethereum assets using the XCM [MultiAsset](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format/blob/master/README.md#multiasset-universal-asset-identifiers) structure.

Inside our parachain, the account balances for bridged ethereum assets are stored within our custom multi-asset [pallet](https://polkaeth-rustdocs.netlify.app/artemis_asset/index.html). Each asset is indentified by a 20-byte address that corresponds to a contract address on the Ethereum side. ETH is a special case and is identified by the zero address.

Example: ETH

```rust
MultiAsset::ConcreteFungible {
  id: MultiLocation::X2(
    Junction::PalletInstance { id: 11 },
    Junction::AccountKey20 { network: NetworkId::Any, key: [0; 20] })
  amount: AMOUNT,
}
```

Example: ERC20

```rust
MultiAsset::ConcreteFungible {
  id: MultiLocation::X2(
    Junction::PalletInstance { id: 11 },
    Junction::AccountKey20 { network: NetworkId::Any, key: CONTRACT_ADDRESS })
  amount: AMOUNT,
}
```

## Supported Transfers

The following scenarios highlight the various kinds of asset transfers supported by our parachain.

### Transfer pETH from the reserve parachain to another parachain <!-- omit in toc -->

In this example, Alice wants to transfer 21 pETH to Bob on another parachain.

Parties:

- H: Home chain (Ethereum Bridge)
- D: Destination chain

Effects:

1. H will withdraw 21 pETH from Alice's local account.
2. The sovereign account of D on H will be credited with 21 pETH.
3. D will mint 21 pETH into Bob's account.

Example Message:
```rust
Xcm::WithdrawAsset {
  assets: vec![MultiAsset::ConcreteFungible {
    id: MultiLocation::X2(
      Junction::PalletInstance { id: 11 },
      Junction::AccountKey20 { network: NetworkId::Any, key: [0; 20] })
    amount: AMOUNT,
  }],
  effects: vec![Order::DepositReserveAsset {
    assets: vec![MultiAsset::All],
    dest: MultiLocation::X2(Junction::Parent, Junction::Parachain { id: DEST_PARA_ID }),
    effects: vec![Order::DepositAsset {
      assets: vec![MultiAsset::All],
      dest: MultiLocation::X1(Junction::AccountId32 {
        network: DEST_NETWORK,
        id: DEST_ACCOUNT,
      }),
    }],
  }],
}
```

### Transfer pETH from a parachain into the reserve parachain <!-- omit in toc -->

In this example, Alice transfers 21 pETH to Bob on the reserve chain

Parties:

- H: Home chain
- D: Destination chain (Ethereum Bridge)

Effects:

1. H will withdraw 21 pETH from Alice's local account.
2. The sovereign account of H on D will be reduced by 21 pETH.
3. D will mint 21 pETH into Bob's account.

Example Message:

```rust
Xcm::WithdrawAsset {
  assets: vec![MultiAsset::ConcreteFungible {
    id: MultiLocation::X2(
      Junction::PalletInstance { id: 11 },
      Junction::AccountKey20 { network: NetworkId::Any, key: [0; 20] })
    amount: AMOUNT,
  }],
  effects: vec![Order::InitiateReserveWithdraw {
    assets: vec![MultiAsset::All],
    reserve: MultiLocation::X2(
      Junction::Parent,
      Junction::Parachain {
        id: DEST_PARA_ID,
      },
    ),
    effects: vec![Order::DepositAsset {
      assets: vec![MultiAsset::All],
      dest: MultiLocation::X1(Junction::AccountId32 {
          network: DEST_NETWORK,
          id: DEST_ACCOUNT,
      })
    }]
  }]
}
```

### Transfer pETH between 2 parachains via the reserve parachain <!-- omit in toc -->

In this scenario, our parachain is acting solely as the reserve chain for two other chains participating in a transfer.

Parties:

- H: Home chain
- D: Destination chain
- R: Reserve Chain (Ethereum Bridge)

Effects:

1. H will withdraw 21 pETH from Alice's local account.
2. The sovereign account of H on R will be reduced by 21 pETH.
3. The sovereign account of D on R will be credited with 21 pETH.
4. D will mint 21 pETH into Bob's account.

Example Message:

```rust
Xcm::WithdrawAsset {
  assets: vec![MultiAsset::ConcreteFungible {
    id: MultiLocation::X2(
      Junction::PalletInstance { id: 11 },
      Junction::AccountKey20 { network: NetworkId::Any, key: [0; 20] })
    amount: AMOUNT,
  }],
  effects: vec![Order::InitiateReserveWithdraw {
    assets: vec![MultiAsset::All],
    reserve: MultiLocation::X2(
      Junction::Parent,
      Junction::Parachain {
          id: RESERVE_CHAIN,
      },
    ),
    effects: vec![Order::DepositReserveAsset {
      assets: vec![MultiAsset::All],
      dest: MultiLocation::X2(Junction::Parent, Junction::Parachain { id: DEST_PARA }),
      effects: vec![Order::DepositAsset {
        assets: vec![MultiAsset::All],
        dest: MultiLocation::X1(Junction::AccountId32 {
          network: DEST_NETWORK,
          id: DEST_ACCOUNT,
        }),
      }],
    }]
  }]
}
```

## Future Extensions

These extensions are still being explored for feasibility and value.

### Transfer from parachain to Ethereum

We could also use XCMP to trigger a transfer of assets from our parachain to Ethereum, and vice versa. Since our parachain and our smart contracts on Ethereum have to trust each other, we could use the [Teleportation](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#transfer-via-teleport) mechanism described in the XCMP spec.

We'll probably want to use a custom message type in the long-term though.

Example message sequence:

```
WithdrawAsset {
  assets: Assets to withdraw
  effects: [
    InitiateTeleport {
      assets: *
      dest: Destination ethereum network
      effects [
        DepositAsset {
          assets: *
          dest: AccountKey20
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Bridge Messaging

Our bridge will support arbitrary messaging between Ethereum smart contracts and parachain apps. We'll need XCMP messages to facilitate this communication. As XCMP is still quite immature and untested, the below ideas are still WIP and likely to change but should provide a starting point for thinking through an initial implementation and early experiments.

XCMP messages are asynchronous and sent in a fire-and-forget manner. Messages sent from Parachains to Ethereum will need to specify a target contract for delivery. Parachains will need to register to be notified of messages coming from Ethereum, and will be notified when relevant messages come through for them.

At the application layer, parachain apps and ethereum smart contracts that interact are responsible for being aware of and trusting each other and for determining the payload and interface of their own messages. The bridge just facilitates transfer, verification and routing of these messages to the requested target application. Our ETHApp and ERC20App are examples of pairs of custom FRAME + solidity applications that trust each other and specify a shared interface - although they're implemented as pallets, one could imagine them working similarily as seperate parachains.


Example: Register a custom FRAME application to receive messages
```
Xcm::Transact {
  origin: *,
  call: Bridge.register(app_id, dispatchable)
}
```

Once an application living on another parachain has been registered, the bridge can issue XCM messages:

```
Xcm::Transact {
  origin: *,
  call: dispatchable (registered in above example)
}
```

In turn, the application would need to notify the bridge in order to unlock assets on the Ethereum side:

```
Xcm::Transact {
  origin: *
  call: Bridge.notify(app_id, payload)
}
```

## Other Issues

### Numeric precision

Our parachain stores asset balances using 256-bit precision to match Ethereum, while XCMP v0 only supports 128-bit precision. Additionally most other asset pallets in the Polkadot ecosystem only support up to 128-bit precision.

The short term solution is keep our 256-bit precision, but perform checked conversion to 128-bits when required. This caps individual transfers to roughly 3.4 × 10<sup>38</sup> wei (3.4 × 10<sup>20</sup> eth), which is still a very huge amount.

In the longer term, for 256-bit precision to be supported in other parachains, we'll need to update [U256](https://docs.rs/primitive-types/0.7.2/primitive_types/struct.U256.html) so that its compatible with other asset pallet implementations.
