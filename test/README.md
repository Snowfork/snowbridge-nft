# E2E Test Archive

This does not run and is merely here for reference.

## Run tests

Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

These tests are meant to closely replicate real-world behaviour. This means that they also replicate real-world delays and confirmation times. This can take up to 4 minutes per test and ~20minutes for all tests.
