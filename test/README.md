# E2E tests

The E2E tests ran against a dockerized services.

## Requirements

1. Development environment for Rust and Substrate. See parachain [requirements](../parachain/README.md#requirements).
2. Development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

   ```bash
   yarn global add truffle
   (cd ../ethereum && yarn install)
    ```
3. Docker and docker-compose

## Setup

Currently, setting up the dockerized environment is partially automated. Full automation requires further work to ensure services start up successfully in the correct dependency order.

Download dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

Run the following commands one by one:
```bash
mkdir build
touch build/parachain.env

# Start ganache service
docker-compose up -d -- ganache

# Ensure ganache starts up successfully
docker-compose logs -f ganache

# change to Ethereum contracts dir
pushd ../ethereum

# Deploy contracts
truffle deploy --network ganache

# Generate configuration for relayer, parachain, and tests
truffle exec scripts/dumpRelayerDockerConfig.js --network ganache
truffle exec scripts/dumpParachainDockerConfig.js --network ganache
truffle exec scripts/dumpAddresses.js --network ganache

# Change back to previous directory
popd

# Start Parachain
docker-compose up -d -- parachain

# Wait until parachain compiles and starts up successfully
docker-compose logs -f parachain

# Start Relayer
docker-compose up -d -- relayer

# Wait until relayer starts up successfully
docker-compose logs -f relayer
```

## Run Tests

```bash
yarn test
```
